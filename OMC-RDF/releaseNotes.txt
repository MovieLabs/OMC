----------

Additions:

Properties:

VERSIONS

Properties:
Asset or Composition -> hasVersion -> Asset or Composition
Asset or Composition -> isVersionOf -> Asset or Composition

Asset or Composition -> isRevisionOf -> Asset or Composition

Asset or Composition -> isVariantOf -> Asset or Composition

---------
NOTE: We cannot formalize the constraint "A Variant of a Composition must be a new Composition"
without introducing a property with the exact domain Composition.

---------

Asset or Composition -> isDerivationOf -> Asset or Composition

Asset or Composition -> hasAlterntive -> Asset or Composition

---------
NOTE: We could formalize the constraint "Alternatives ... do not apply to Asset Structural Characteristics"
by intersecting the domain with "not AssetAsStructure" but it would make it less readable.
