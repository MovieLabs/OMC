ASSETS

----------

----------

Additions:

Properties:
DigitalData -> hasFileDetails -> FileDetails

Classes:
DigitalDocument subclass of DigitalData (as well as of DocumentAsset, as previously)

VERSIONS

Properties:
Asset or Composition -> hasVersion -> Asset or Composition
Asset or Composition -> isVersionOf -> Asset or Composition

Asset or Composition -> isRevisionOf -> Asset or Composition

Asset or Composition -> isVariantOf -> Asset or Composition

---------
NOTE: We cannot formalize the constraint "A Variant of a Composition must be a new Composition"
without introducing a property with the exact domain Composition.

---------

Asset or Composition -> isDerivationOf -> Asset or Composition

Asset or Composition -> hasAlterntive -> Asset or Composition

---------
NOTE: We could formalize the constraint "Alternatives ... do not apply to Asset Structural Characteristics"
by intersecting the domain with "not AssetAsStructure" but it would make it less readable.

CREATIVE WORK:

Fixed domain of hasCountry to be a union, not multiple triples (which would imply that each domain is equal to the others).

Added property hasCountryOfOrigin as a subproperty of hasCountry, domain CreativeWork, range Country. 
(QUESTION: does this render cw:hasCountry obsolete?)

------------------------------

(NOTE: ranges SpecialEffect and VisualEffect are subclasses of ProductionObject.)

Added properties needs and isNeededBy, inverses of each other.

Changed domain and range of uses to match document. Same for usedBy - not usedIn as the document says,
because usedIn applies to narrative items. 

Added properties isRepresentedBy and represents, inverses of each other.
