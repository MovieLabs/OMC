# Versions

A more complete position paper on versioning is currently under development, below we outline some basic definitions.

Support for expressing a version, variant and representation will be included in future revisions of the schema.

## Version
In general, a version is a particular form of something. It can be used in the same circumstances as the thing of which it is a version - its differences are not enough to fundamentally change what it is. Some systems call these "revisions" or "iterations."

For example, a changed drawing is a version of the original drawing, and a CG model of a spaceship with a different engine exhaust is a new version of the original spaceship.

## Variant
A variant is a distinct new thing that is still innately related to the thing from which it is derived. A model of a car with dents is a variant of the model of the car without dents.

## Representation
A representation is another, equivalent form of something. For example, a low-res proxy of a video is a representation of a high-res original.
