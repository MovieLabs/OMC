No production happens with out the people that show up and do the work, so being able to describe and manage and understand the Participants is a critical part of managing a production. In the ontology the Participants are not just the people, but it is often useful to think of Participants a groups of people, departments or organizations as well as the various services that are used to execute functions.

Like other aspects of the ontology Participants have both a structural and functional component. The structural part being the actual person or organization, the functional representing the role, or what they do on the production.

Separating these parts out allows for considerable flexibility in structuring and managing participants.

#### Setup roles without a person
Most productions know they need certain roles filled before they have hired specific candidates for those roles. As an example a Participant with the role of Gaffer can setup with just it's functional characteristics, but absent the structural characteristics.

Later when a hiring decision is made the specific person is related to the participant. Any other relationships that were established regarding scheduling or responsibilities remain.

If that person has to be changed at a later date, only the relationship to the person is changed. The Participant itself remains related to all of it's relative context such as which production scenes they are needed on, etc.

#### Multiple roles
Sometimes people perform multiple roles, a person acts and directs for example. Despite being the same person these would be two separate Participants, but related to the same person. This allows each Participant (for the separate roles) to be related to relevant aspects of the production independently, providing a clear separation of responsibilities. This allows things like notifications and scheduling to be governed by the role.
- If our person is acting in a scene on a particular day, they will need hair/makeup and wardrobe, their call times would be different than if they were only directing on that day 
- There can be important considerations for security, different roles are typically granted different levels of access to production assets.

#### Delegation
It is common to hire an organization to carry out a specific role or job on a production, without the requirement that the production company specifically know the details of each individual doing the work. A catering company for craft service or a vfx studio hired to do an effects shot. In these scenarios a trusted contractor may be delegated access to certain assets and the company is then left to manage individual access.

## Participant Groups

Participants, like other entities, can be arbitrarily grouped. A Participant group is a group of Participants, which in themselves could be Participant Groups, creating a hierarchical structure. A camera unit is an example of arbitrary group, where a set of people will share some set of attributes, like scheduling information.






### Personal notes - to be deleted

Why a Participants and not just a person
- Participants can also be groups, organizations, services
- Sometime you know you need someone, but you don't know who yet
- Participants also describe the role, and this allows the role to stay the same and the person to change

Roles vs Job title
Using roles in other parts of the workflow

How do portrayals work with Participants
- Often a character is portrayed by more than one person
- When connected to a production scene, you can figure who was on set that day doing the portrayal
