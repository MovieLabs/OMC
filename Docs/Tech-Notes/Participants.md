No production happens with out the people that show up and do the work, so being able to describe and manage and understand the Participants is a critical part of managing a production. In the ontology the Participants are not just the people, but it is often useful to think of Participants a groups of people, departments or organizations as well as the various services that are used to execute functions.

Like other aspects of the ontology Participants have both a structural and functional component. The structural part being the actual person or organization, the functional representing the role has person on the production.

Separating these parts out allows for considerable flexibility in structuring and managing participants.

Most productions know they need certain roles filled before they have potentially hired for those roles. For example, a Participant with the role of Gaffer is setup with a Role as part of it's functional characteristics, but absent the structural characteristics.

Later when a hiring decision is made the specific person is related to the participant. Any other relationships that were established regarding scheduling or responsibilities remain.

- If that person has to be changed at a later date, only the relationship to the person is changed. The Participant itself is still related to all of it's relative context, the scheduling, which scenes they are used in, etc.
- Sometimes people perform multiple roles, actor, directors for example. Each of these would be a separate Participant related to the same Person. Each Participant (for the separate roles) is in turn related to the other relevant aspects of the production independently, so that notifications, scheduling and responsibilities can be governed by the role. This can have important considerations for security, where different roles are often granted different levels of access to production assets.
- Often Organizations are hired to carry out specific roles or jobs, without need for the production company to specifically know the details of each individual. A catering company for craft service, a vfx studio is hired to do an effects shot. In these scenarios certain things may be delegated to the organization, such as access to certain assets and the company is trusted to manage individual access.

## Participant Groups

Participants, like other entities, can be arbitrarily grouped. A Participant groups is a group of Participants, which in themselves could be Participant Groups, creating a hierarchical structure. A camera unit is an example of arbitrary group, where a set of people will share some set of attributes, like scheduling information.








Why a Participants and not just a person
- Participants can also be groups, organizations, services
- Sometime you know you need someone, but you don't know who yet
- Participants also describe the role, and this allows the role to stay the same and the person to change

Using roles in other parts of the workflow

How do portrayals work with Participants
- Often a character is portrayed by more than one person
- When connected to a production scene, you can figure who was on set that day doing the portrayal
