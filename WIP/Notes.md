### Assets

Other Use Cases
- Multiple instances of the same thing
	- Multiple physical props
	- Multiple digital instances *(this is no different in mechanism from than a physical copy and a digital copy)*
- Any issues with versions or variants when it comes to asset groups?


When a production requires multiple copies of the same thing how does this manifest.
- For physical props, each instance would need a unique essence id, because each can be physically in separate places. Do they have a unique asset id?
- For digital versions we can leave that up to the production.


*General Notes:*
- *Functional and structural characteristics are not themselves entities, they do not have their own identifiers*
- *An asset entity only has one functional and structural characteristic, this is no longer an array*
- *A useful side effect of having separate identifiers for the 'whole' asset and the essence is that this more clearly delineates information and item, meaning security authorization can be more easily separated, some applications may only need access to metadata*
