# Schema Introduction

## JSON
OMC-JSON is a specification for exchanging information between applications and workflows during the production and media based productions like movie and television shows.

OMC-JSON uses [JavaScript Object Notation]([Information on RFC 8259 Â» RFC Editor](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8259)) to serialize information that can be exchanged or transmitted over

## JSON-Schema
OMC-JSON is written using the [JSON-Schema specification draft 2019-09](https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09)

JSON-Schema provides a vocabulary constraining JSON data such that it complies with a set of defined rules. JSON-Schema is itself written in JSON.

To carry out validation a JSON-Schema and the JSON data must be 

## Documentation

The documentation is arranged into a series of documents, mostly by entity. In addition there are some sub-schemas that describe the core structure of the OMC-JSON and are not specific to OMC-JSON schema rather than the broader ontology or data model. There are also a set of utility sub-schemas that are referenced from other places.

#### Property
The property name, which is case sensitive
#### Constraint
Schema restraints place some sort of restriction or rule on the property value

| enum       | Value must match one of the values of the enumerated list, the documentation may show those values in the **Type** column, or in a separate table if more space is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ctrlValue  | This is a special value that is not part of the JSON-Schema vocabulary. Controlled Values are part of the OMC ontology, they are considered best practice but are not enforced by the schemas, these terms are typically defined in by the schema and therefore can be universally recognized.<br><br>Using a value that is not a controlled value means parties consuming OMC-JSON may not understand the meaning of the value.<br><br>These values are case sensitive. |
| oneOf      | A choice of sub-schemas are available and data must validate against one and only one of the available options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| anyOf      | A choice of sub-schemas may be used and data can validate against any of the available options. This is often used where an property value is an array, each object in the array must independently be valid against one or more of the listed schemas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| pattern    | A regular expression (regEx) is used to validate the value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
*Notes:*
- *Additional explanation and examples are available in the JSON-Schema documentation linked above.*
- *Almost all sub-schemas are restricted from having additional properties, [customData](../Utility/Utility.md#customData) is provided for optional user data not covered by OMC *

#### Type
The type of value allowed, this may be a JSON privative such as 'string', 'number' or 'null', an OMC-JSON property or set of controlled values which will be linked in the Type field.
#### Description
A description of the property and what it represents in the ontology.

### Additional Notes
For those of you who spend time examining the schema you may find small technical discrepancies between its structure versus that presented in these documents. These should be functionally equivalent and are done to improve readability of the documentation.

In the schema some properties reference utility sub-schemas that only operate as constraints, i.e. they are a pattern property or have min/max. In these cases the Property column is omitted for clarity.
